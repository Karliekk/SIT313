what you have implemented : I have done the splash screen and list view for my Contact App during this two weeks
what you have learned: I have learned how to use Xamarin with both of IOS platform and Android platform.
what did work : The list view and splash screen all works and the username and password validating are working well
what didnâ€™t work : the second topic of week 4 practice I have done it well. Because I can not fix the errors in the code.
Time spent: Most of my time spent on the project and I often go to the practice session to ask questions to tutor
Plan for next week:
I will try my best to finish my project 1 and hand in it on time.
